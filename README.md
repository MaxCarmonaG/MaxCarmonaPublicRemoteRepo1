Lab 1 - Full Stack Deployment

My name is Max Carmona and I have been working as a Front-end web developer for 4 years now. I consider myself a good engineer because Iâ€™m so passionate about solving complex problems and delivering results. I always try to give my best and I don't feel uncomfortable facing new challenges, because there is always an opportunity to learn something new or to improve my skills.

Gabriel Fiorotti - I'm happy to contribute in Max's repo during Lab 1 of the Full Stack Deployment course.
